## Demo
You may have a look at [core-layout](http://mtr.github.io/core-layout/examples/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/mtr/core-layout/)), an Angular demo app that shows how you can use the `iscroll` directive in a responsive-design web-app with support for both drawers (slide-out menus) and modals.  For example, the demo shows how to handle DOM content generated dynamically through [ngRepeat](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat).

## Usage

In the following, `IScroll` (with capital 'I' and 'S') refers to instances 
of the [iScroll Javascript library](http://iscrolljs.com/) that this package provides an AngularJS wrapper for. 

The main usage pattern for `angular-iscroll` is to define a dependency on the `angular-iscroll` module in your AngularJS app.  For example: 
```js
angular.module('myApp', ['angular-iscroll']);
```
or, in a Browserify-based code base:
```js
angular.module('myApp', [require('angular-iscroll').name]);
```

The `angular-iscroll` module includes both a directive, `iscroll`, and a service, `iScrollService`, which gives you access to and control over a shared, global state of whether to enable, disable, or refresh the `IScroll` instances for each `iscroll` directive instance.

Next, to use the directive, you should set up your HTML template like
```html
…
<body ng-controller="MyAppController as app"
      ng-class="{
      'iscroll-on': app.iScrollState.useIScroll,
      'iscroll-off': !app.iScrollState.useIScroll
      }">
<div class="iscroll-wrapper" iscroll>
  <div class="iscroll-scroller">
  </div>
</div>
…
```
Let me explain the essential parts of that HTML example.  First of all, the `iscroll` directive is an attribute of an element belonging to the `iscroll-wrapper` class, which wraps an element of the `iscroll-scroller` class.  Those two classes are defined in the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) file [dist/lib/scss/_iscroll.scss](dist/lib/scss/_iscroll.scss), but they don't have any meaning unless they occur inside an `iscroll-on` class; and that's where the shared, global state from iScrollService comes in.  The controller, `MyAppController`, in the above example exposes the state variable shared by iScrollService in its scope
```js
function MyAppController(iScrollService) {
    var vm = this;  // Use 'controller as' syntax 

    vm.iScrollState = iScrollService.state;
}
```
thereby providing a way to globally change the meaning of the `iscroll-wrapper` + `iscroll-scroller` combination.  Please note: To get more info about the "controller as" syntax, you might enjoy [John Papa's AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide#controlleras-with-vm).

Furthermore, the global iScroll state exposed by the service should be changed through the service's `enable([signalOnly])`, `disable([signalOnly])`, and `toggle([signalOnly])` methods, where each method will change the state accordingly, and then emit a corresponding signal from `$rootScope` that gets picked up and handled by the available `angular-iscroll` directive instances.  If the `signalOnly` flag is `true`, then the state is not changed by the service method, but the signal is sent nonetheless.  If the directives receive an `iscroll:disabled` signal, they will destroy any existing `IScroll` instances, and if they receive an `iscroll:enabled` signal, they will create a new `IScroll` instances per directive instance if it doesn't already exist.

It should also be noted that during instantiation, in the directive's post-link phase, the `iscroll` directive will check the `iScrollService`'s `useIScroll` state to decide whether or not it will create an actual `IScroll` instance.  Consequently, if you would like to create an AngularJS solution that uses iScroll only on, for example, iOS devices, you should determine the current browser type early, probably inside the app controller's [configuration block](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module#module-loading-dependencies), and set the service's `useIscroll` state accordingly.  Please note that `angular-iscroll` does not contain any code to detect which browser or platform it is currently running on, which is a separate, complex task better solved by specialized libraries, like [platform.js](https://github.com/bestiejs/platform.js).


### Manual Interaction with Each Directive's IScroll Instance
If you want access to a scope's `IScroll` instance, you can supply an optional 
`iscroll-instance` attribute when applying the `iscroll` directive, like
```html
…
<div class="iscroll-wrapper" iscroll iscroll-instance="instance">
  <div class="iscroll-scroller">
  </div>
</div>
…
```
That way, the scope's `instance` variable will hold a reference to the actual
 `IScroll` instance, so you can access the IScroll instance's own API, for 
 example to define [custom events](http://iscrolljs.com/#custom-events) or 
 access its [scroller info](http://iscrolljs.com/#scroller-info).


### Configuration
I've designed this module so that it should be easy to configure.  First of all, you can supply per-instance options, both for `IScroll` and the directive itself, when you apply the directive.  For example
```html
<div iscroll="{mouseWheel: true, momentum: true, refreshInterval: 500}">…</div>
```
would pass along the options `{mouseWheel: true, momentum: true}` to `IScroll`, while the directive-specific configuration parameter, `{refreshInterval: 500}`, is only interpreted by the directive.  Any config option not recognized as a directive-specific option, will be forwarded to `IScroll`.

There are lots of configuration options for IScroll itself; those are best [documented by iScroll](http://iscrolljs.com/#configuring).

#### Directive Options
The directive provides two configuration options:

- `asyncRefreshDelay` (default `0`): defines the delay, in ms, before the directive asynchronously performs an IScroll.refresh().  If `false`, then no async refresh is performed.  This can come in handy when you need to wait for the DOM to be rendered before `IScroll` can know the size of its scrolling area.
- `refreshInterval` (default `false`): a delay, in ms, between each periodic iScroll.refresh().  If `false`, then no periodic refresh is performed.  This functionality can be handy in complex applications, where it might be difficult to decide when `iScrollService.refresh()` should be called, and a periodic call to `IScroll.refresh()`, for example every 500 ms, might provide a smooth user experience.  To avoid scroll stuttering caused by calls to refresh during an ongoing scroll operation, the `angular-iscroll` directive prevents `refresh()` calls if IScroll is currently performing a scroll operation.
- `invokeApply` (default `false`, since version _2.0.0_): whether or not to invoke AngularJS' `$apply()` (and thereby `$digest()`) cycle on every refresh, as determined by `asyncRefreshDelay` or `refreshInterval`.  When `false`, it will not invoke model dirty checking on every call to `IScroll.refresh()`.  This can result in huge performance gain if `refreshInterval` is set to a low value (for example 500 ms).  Example usage:

        iScrollServiceProvider.configureDefaults({
            iscroll: {
               invokeApply:false
           }
        });

    To test it, you can paste this code to your app `run` block:

        /**
         * This code measures `$digest()` performance
         * by logging digest times to the console.
         */
        var $oldDigest = $rootScope.$digest;
        var $newDigest = function() {
                console.time("$digest");
               $oldDigest.apply($rootScope);
                console.timeEnd("$digest");
        };
        $rootScope.$digest = $newDigest;

    With `invokeApply = true` and `refreshInterval = 500` you'll see that digest is run every 500ms.
    With `invokeApply = false` and `refreshInterval = 500` you'll see that digest is not invoked by `angular-iscroll`.

    Thanks to [DinkoMiletic](https://github.com/DinkoMiletic) for implementing this optimization.


#### Globally Configuring the Directive's Default Options

The `iscroll` directive gets its default configuration from the `iScrollService`.  To provide a way to easily, globally configure the defaults for all `iscroll` instances, the module defines an `iScrollServiceProvider` which can be injected into the app controller's configuration block which is guaranteed to run before the controller is used anywhere.  For example:
```js
/* @ngInject */
function _config(iScrollServiceProvider) {
    // Supply a default configuration object, eg:
    iScrollServiceProvider.configureDefaults({
        iScroll: {
            // Passed through to the iScroll library
            scrollbars: true,
            fadeScrollbars: true
        },
        directive: {
            // Interpreted by the directive
            refreshInterval: 500
        }
    });
}

angular
    .module('myApp', ['angular-iscroll'])
    .config(_config);
```
The configuration you provide this way will serve as the updated global default for all `iscroll` directive instances.

Please note that the above example relies on [ng-annotate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-annotate) for adding AngularJS dependency-injection annotations during builds, as indicated by the `/* @ngInject */` comment.

## Support ##
Thanks to a generous “free for Open Source” sponsorship from [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) I've been able to test [core-layout](http://mtr.github.io/core-layout/examples/), and thereby [angular-iscroll](https://github.com/mtr/angular-iscroll/), with a plethora of devices and browsers.  The following browsers and devices has been tested successfully:

* Desktop
  * Chrome 16–48 on OS X 10.10
  * Chrome 48 on Ubuntu 14.04
  * Firefox 6.0–43.0 on OS X 10.10
  * Firefox 43.0.4 on Ubuntu 14.04
  * Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11 on Windows 7
  * Internet Explorer Edge 12 on Windows 10
  * Opera 12.12–34 on OS X 10.10
  * Safari 5.1.7 on Windows 10
  * Safari 8.0.8 on OS X 10.10.5

### Incompatible Browsers ###
During testing, the [core-layout](http://mtr.github.io/core-layout/examples/) demo broke in the following browsers:

* Firefox 3.6, 4, and 5 on OS X 10.10
* Internet Explorer 8 on Windows 7 (fails during jQuery version 2.2.0 initialization):
  ```
  // Use the handy event callback
  document.addEventListener( "DOMContentLoaded", completed );
  ```
  Error message: `Object doesn't support this property or method`.
* Safari 3 with iOS 3 on iPhone 3GS

This does not necessarily mean that `angular-iscroll` itself breaks in the same browsers, but the demo code did.
